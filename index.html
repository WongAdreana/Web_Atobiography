        <p>Hello there, My name is Allyza Kaye Wong. I'am 21 years old, born on September 1, 2003, in Olongapo City, but now live in Dili Sta. Cruz Ilocos Sur and a 3rd year college student at Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College (ISPSC). And I'm the second-oldest sister in a family of 7 children (3 boys and 4 girls); my eldest sister already has a family of her own. My mother, Jacquelyn W. Caballes is a housewife, while my father, Alejandro V. Caballes, is the one who works to provide for all our needs.</p>

        <p>When I was an elementary student it was full innocent laughter, and I enjoyed all the things a child can enjoy and always thought that everything would stay the same in my life, like same house, same neighborhood, same school, same classmate, but everything can change, and that happiness was taken away when my parents separated (family problem). My father took all my siblings, including me, here in the province to start anew and also to continue our studies, then months later, both my parents got together again. (hahahaha)</p>

        <p>I graduated from Dili Elementary School (DNHS) in the blink of an eye and started my high school life at Dili National High School. My high school life is neither exciting nor interesting; it's just the normal life of a student, where my routines are always the same: go to school, home, and church, then repeat. That's my daily life. Well, for me ot's not that boring because it's what I want, so I'm satisfied.</p>

        <p>I graduated from high school and then started my college life at Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College (ISPSC), where all potential skills can bloom, instructed by skilled instructors. For me, this is the start of a challenge that can help me grow further if I take it seriously and set it as my foundation.</p>
